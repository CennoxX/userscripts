This script adds the ability to edit scrobbles on Last.fm, even if you don't have Last.fm PRO. It works as a combination of an authenticated Last.fm application to scrobble the corrected song – so you'll have to allow access to the Last.fm application (named "PlaylistLover") first – and JavaScript on the page to simulate a click on delete of the old song. This only works up to 14 days in the past.
